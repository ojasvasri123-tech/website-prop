Panic can make situations much worse and prevent us from thinking clearly.\n\nI've heard that practicing emergency drills regularly can help, but I'm curious about other techniques. Do you have any strategies for staying calm during disasters?\n\nSome things I've tried:\n- Deep breathing exercises\n- Having a clear emergency plan\n- Regular practice of emergency procedures\n- Staying informed but not overwhelmed by news\n\nWhat works for you? Any tips from psychology or personal experience?",

It reminded me how important it is to know your neighbors and have local support networks.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with flooding? What did you learn?",
